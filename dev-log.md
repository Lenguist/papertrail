Oct 25, 2025 This is the first entry in dev log for paper trail (goodreads for papers)

Idea came to me first through Veronika, and then again when I was thinkign about how being able to track progress on # of papers read can help with motivation and consistency reading papers

Esp since in other places in my life tracking progress and social feature had huge impact. For example strava and goodreads.

Additionally I thoguht this is a good thing for me to biuld since I have a lot of researcher friends, and even those who are not reseearchers all read papers.

In general, prettymuch *everyone* recognized the arxiv shirt. So everyone spends time there, everyone has the experience of printing a paper to read it, etc. So why not make it a more social activity?

I then asked chatgpt if smth similar exists, and it basically doesn't. There are many apps for tracking what you read (zotero, sematnic scholar, etc), and some apps that incorporate papers+social elemt (google scholar) but nothing really that allows for social reading of papers.

+ reading groups are extremely popular obv. So anyway I think there is great untapped potential here.

Gonna aim to buildv1 of mvp today and push it out. 

Another thought: rn there is also heavily missing a good engine for paper discovery. Twitter is kind of like that, nad citations, and semantic scholar and conferences and so on, but there def can be more.
